    This class implements the graph SLAM frontend
    
    Functions construct the graph information by:
    - Register elements of the extended state vector as poses or landmarks
    - Register motion constraints between pose-pose pairs based in external model generated covariances 
    - Register observation constraints between pose-landmark pairs based on external model generated covariances
